Usage: pl0_vm_rs [flags] <filename>

Program for executing compiled PL0 bytecode.
When run without specifying options, the bytecode will be executed directly.

Flags:
  -a, --analyze\tOutput bytecode analysis information. (doesn't run the program)
  -d, --debug\tOutput debug information while running the program. (outputs operations being run, with additional information)
  -h, --help\tDisplay this message and exit.
  --lang=[lang]\tSet language - supported for [lang]: de (German), en (English)
